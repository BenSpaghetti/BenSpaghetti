## What I'm Doing

Studying for HKDSE, STEP and MAT

**Reading**

Maths books (I don't really have the ability to read any of these lol, probably won't change for a long time): \
Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze \
Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin \
Algebra: Chapter 0 by Aluffi

Normal books \
None at the moment unfortunately

**Watching**

Michael Penn's Abstract Linear Algebra lectures: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1wONAFFjMV9c0QaNuyfT5Gk)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1wONAFFjMV9c0QaNuyfT5Gk)\
For some reason, some videos are missing from this playlist as of the time of writing.

**Wikipedia Browsing**

I like to browse Wikipedia in my spare time and tend to focus on a single topic for some time. I am currently investigating the history of Ireland and her relationship with her neighbours. Read more about my Wikipedia browsing [here](wiki/wiki.md).

## Internet Archaeology
(not the journal) \
I am proposing the study of internet archaeology. The Internet is large place, containing more information than we could ever find. I am especially interested in the location of rare and old files on the internet. 

My proudest find is a pre-Grothendieck algebraic geometry textbook. You may take a look [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14mK90E8XDn2F4dEvfJ56SLfwxevUg8HZ/view?usp=sharing). I hope internet police do not take down this website :).

The above file is scanned from Imperial College London's library. Indeed, this file is accessible to many, and I am sure many libraries in London or the UK in general contains this book. Yet the UK is only home to under 68 million people. It would not be possible for people in other places in varying social and financial positions to easily access such a file. (so in fact internet archaeology is just a fancier way of saying internet browsing and in some cases pirating lmao)

## Some goals that I will never achieve
1. Actually pay some attention to schoolwork. My DSE grades aren't even gonna be up to CUHK Maths standards if I continue ignoring Core, Physics and Chemistry lmao.
2. Get 1, 1 in STEP (worst case is probably 1, 2, good case is probably S, 1, currently I'm 1.25, 2 lol)
3. Read less MSE/Reddit/Zhihu and do more maths
