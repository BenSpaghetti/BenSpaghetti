# Trying to strike a balance between examinations and maths learning

Over the past month, I have been studying mathematics for several hours a day, and of course sleeping for the rest. I have enjoyed this period and have experimented and settled on what I think is the best textbook reading method for me. Unfortunately, it is time for this period to end. Pressures from the upcoming STEP and school final exam, which will decide my predicted grades, are closing in. It is time for me to focus on practicing STEP and learning/revising physics and chemistry and catching up with schoolwork in general.

In particular, I have chosen to stop regularly reading Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Gallian and only use it when I need concepts from a standard algebra class. I am currently focusing on Baby Rudin, intending to finish Chapter 2 in this special holiday.

Of course, the best case is to do both, and I imagine I actually have the potential to do both. But then of course I am not willing to put in the work lmao.
