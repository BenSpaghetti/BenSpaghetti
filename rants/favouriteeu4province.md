In no particular order

## 1. Constantinople
City of the world's desire, saying anymore would be an insult.
## 2. Lyonnais
Nice mountain fort in France, I have eradicated many French and HRE troops there. Love the shape of the province.
## 3. Den Haag
Whenever I get the Burgundian Inheritance, I move my capital there to prevent the Dutch Revolt. Again, the shape of the province is very nice (as you can see this is the main reason I like a province lol).
## 4. Warszawa  
The Polish capital, often a level 1 fort and exposed without any fort blocking the way. Easily occupied.
## 5. Ceuta
One of the African provinces in the Sevilla trade node. Is a centre of trade, can be added to trade company by Western European nations. Has a fort, is disadvantaged terrain. Has a cool shape too :)
## 6. Alexandria
Very nice fort location. I have killed many Mamluk troops there. Brings back the memories of playing as Spain.
## 7. Diu
I will offer no explanation.
