**CORRECT ME IF THERE IS ANY MISTAKE** \
**NONE OF THIS IS CONFIRMED, I WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MESSING UP YOUR LIFE**

## Theory

CUHK Science sounds very multiverse right OOOHH SCIENCE, but it is quite easy to get into even with shitty grades. Refer to the image below:

## Application

Take DSE 1 year early in Form 5, achieve those grades, if you are not confident in English, you don't need 5, 4 is also fine. Put emphasis on m2 5* if you want to do maths since it gets you into the honours maths courses. If you do other science, increase your grade on that elective and m2 5* is optional. 

Congratulations, you have just skipped the grueling period of your life called Form 6 (although your form 5 may be a bit busy). Have a good time in CUHK!
