## On lying flat
I will not continue lying flat anymore. Perhaps I will do that when I am more independent, but right now, it is an irresponsible move. It is unfair to those who put effort in me and care about me, nor is it fair to those affected by my work. Of course I can lie flat if I ask them to stop caring, and detach myself from communities, but I am too much of a coward to do that, as I have always been

## Death
I'm 16, 17 this year. Hong Kong's life expectancy is 85.16 years. With my obesity, I'll probably die before that. So over a fifth of my life has passed already. I have done nothing.

## Prince and Princess
So when I was small, people were creating stupid prince and princess stories. Proves that humans are naturally feudalistic eh? Anyway, it often goes like this:
> In Potato Kingdom, the Potato Prince and Potato Princess were best friends growing up. And then they married each other and lived happily ever after.

It seemed rather innocent at the time, until you realise that they were from the same kingdom.
