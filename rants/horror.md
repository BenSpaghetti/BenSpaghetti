# Shower thoughts
This is a constantly updating article, documenting some shower thoughts I had.

## Death
I'm 16, 17 this year. Hong Kong's life expectancy is 85.16 years. With my obesity, I'll probably die before that. So over a fifth of my life has passed already. I have done nothing. I am afraid of death, I truly am. I am now convinced that immortality is a curse, for without the looming end, there is nothing pushing me to actually do stuff.

## Prince and Princess
So when I was small, people were creating stupid prince and princess stories. Proves that humans are naturally feudalistic eh? Anyway, it often goes like this:
> In Potato Kingdom, the Potato Prince and Potato Princess were best friends growing up. And then they married each other and lived happily ever after.

It seemed rather innocent at the time, until you realise that they were from the same kingdom.
