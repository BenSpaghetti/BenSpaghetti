# Horrifying Realisations
This is a constantly updating article, documenting some horrifying realisations/shower thoughts I had.

## Prince and Princess
So when I was small, people were creating stupid prince and princess stories. Proves that humans are naturally feudalistic eh? Anyway, it often goes like this:
> In Potato Kingdom, the Potato Prince and Potato Princess were best friends growing up. And then they married each other and lived happily ever after.

It seemed rather innocent at the time, until you realise that they were from the same kingdom.
