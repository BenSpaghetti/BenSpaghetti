Dover has disappeared, much like George Perelman, for 10 years already, only with numerous unconfirmed sightings. He was last seen solemn beside Tito's tomb. Dover was never a man of politics, but he has expressed some communist ideals in outbursts with his friends and family. Eason Wong, who has been friends with him since secondary school, said that Dover is a follower of the Russian anarchist Bakunin. All in all, Ben has been a phenomenon for the last 2 decades, but he is starting to be forgotten.

It was a cold winter night in January 2043, a winter snowstorm howled over a birch shack. The only sign of life is the approaching of death. Our familiar friend Ben Dover was laying over a pile of rags, grunts came out of his throat. With a sharp screech, his life came to an end. A bright spot in the history of mathematics dimmed and extinguished into the void. My dear reader, may we walk into this shack and see the genius of the century one last time. He is only 37, yet wrinkles lined his face. His skin was like parchment, all but confirming his unusual death. Let us travel back in history and follow Mr Dover through the ages.
