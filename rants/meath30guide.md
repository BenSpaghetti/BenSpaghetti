# EU4 Meath 1.30.6 Guide
published 2022/03/26

## Why Meath?
Meath does not exist at game start unfortunately. Its capital (and only province) Mide, also known as the Pale, is owned by England at the start of the game. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Meath), the province Meath is the traditional seat of the High Kings, even today, this area contains Dublin, the Irish capital (although the present County Meath is a separate entity and Meath is no longer a province).

I do realise this does not answer the question of why Meath lol.

## Our starting position

We choose England at game start, and release and play as Meath. We are a vassal under England at game start (similar to Cornwall, in fact, I referenced [this Cornwall guide](https://imgur.com/gallery/JMCXeGP)). England is particularly rich in content at game start, with events like the Surrender of Maine and the War of the Roses.

As a newly released nation, our ruler is randomly generated. This guarantees a good ruler as long as we are willing to bird. You have 100% crownland game start. You WILL be rich for a few years after gaining independence from England.

## First day moves

Not much, we must make use of what we have to gain a strong position. If we have a ruler high in admin, then we can safely choose to focus on military, if not, focus on admin. We will be doing a lot of coring after gaining independence. I highly recommend using our full crownland and choose the 3 priviledges that give you monarch points. The rest is not really important (you can choose to sell your crownland some time later for some money).

## Preparing to gain independence

The possible countries you may ask to support your independence are: Scotland, France, Burgundy, Castile and Aragon. England will ally some of these countries at game start, but I highly recommend restarting until Burgundy rivals England for a chance at the Burgundian Inheritance. From my own experience, I do not recommend asking for support from Scotland, they are one of your main targets after gaining independence. 

From my past experience, France and Burgundy can deal with Englands continental allies, particularly those in Iberia like Portugal. Denmark is usually a very good choice too. The combined army and navy of Scandinavia can easily overpower England, and they will actually land troops on England and achieve full occupation.

Similar to the Cornwall guide, it is advisable not to build up your army at first to conserve money. You should use the monarch points to develop your province after a few years. Remember to turn on the state edict to get dev cost reduction.

Remember that you have a 15 year truce with England, and that they will start to annex you some time after that. It does take a while though.

Some countries, particularly England, may choose to influence you, giving you some monarch points too.

## Independence

The events for England are vital to your independence. 

### Surrender of Maine

The Surrender of Maine is a good opportunity to get England to land on France.

### War of the Roses 

### Peace

For the peace deal, I highly recommend taking land from England in Wales and Cornwall.

## After independence

Hopefully you have some claims on Ireland now. Using the war reparations you have, your economy will be fine for a few years. Hire some mercenaries and conquer Ireland and Scotland. You may choose to start conquring in mainland Europe, particularly in Brittany if you can make claims on it.
