# Why do I take STEP

Why are you taking STEP? Over the past month, this question has been directed at me for at least 3 times, probably more. Other questions such as 'I thought Oxford doesn't require STEP' and 'Aren't you supposed to take it next year?' almost immediately follows. So it makes sense for me to write an article about this.

First, some clarifications. I am planning to take STEP this June (haven't registered yet). Yes, it is one year earlier than normal. Yes, I am applying to Oxford. No, Oxford doesn't require STEP. No, I am not hokgod.

Although Oxford does not require STEP, it is clearly stated on its website that if the applicant has STEP grades, it will be taken into consideration. It seems to me that as long as you meet the 'official Cambridge requirement', which is 1, 1, taking STEP will not be a detriment to your application. I will not explain the reasoning behind this thought unless I get rejected by Oxford (but then my opinion should be discarded anyway).

However, it does seem to me that taking STEP will not bring your application to a whole new level even if you manage to get S, S. Several users on Zhihu have reported that some people getting 3s in STEP have been admitted yet some getting S, S have not. It is curious whether this information if true and if so, why Oxford has chosen to reject those getting S, S, who have surely also obtained a high mark in MAT.

Taking STEP is a personal choice, and it is not guaranteed to be beneficial to your application. I bear no responsibility for the validity of information presented in this text except for those directly related to me. Remember, no source of information about admissions can be taken without a grain of salt except for those directly stated on the University websites and personal experiences, which can be very misleading.
