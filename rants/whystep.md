# Why do I take STEP (Update: and other stuff concerning Oxbridge admissions)
published 2022-03-30

Update 2022-05-08 (scroll down for the original article):

I come back to this article with some new information. 

First, below is my comment on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/ukx9tv/mat_maths_exams/).

>You must sit for MAT the year you apply, I suppose you can sit MAT the year before you apply but you would need to sit the MAT again.

>STEP is a different story though. Since the STEP requirement is given in your offer, it is possible for Cambridge to drop STEP from your offer if you got 1, 1 or above. Note that if you don't get S, S, Cambridge may still require you to take it again to see if 'you have improved'. For universities like Imperial and Warwick that only give STEP as a supplement to MAT, well if you can take STEP a year early I don't think your MAT grades will be too bad.

>I'm not sure how STEP is considered by Oxford but I remember that they did say on the website that the results will be considered if you have obtained them. I would think that, similar to taking other exams early, that it would not be beneficial to your application if you obtained less than a 1,1.

>As usual, olympiads are nice to have on your application but is not preferred if you have other super-curricular activities like self-studying or if you really are brilliant, research. You can also take the AEA or the TMUA but I don't know enough about it.

Next, I read on Zhihu (forgot which post, sorry :( ) that the MAT is quite useless in differentiating students who are from extremely exam oriented education systems. Indeed, many from those education systems do ALL the past papers and it just becomes a game of exam preparation skills. As I have heard, as a result, they are upping the difficulty of MAT in 2023. So watch out I guess.

## Original article:

Why are you taking STEP? Over the past month, this question has been directed at me for at least 3 times, probably more. Other questions such as 'I thought Oxford doesn't require STEP' and 'Aren't you supposed to take it next year?' almost immediately follows. So it makes sense for me to write an article about this.

First, some clarifications. I am planning to take STEP this June (haven't registered yet). Yes, it is one year earlier than normal. Yes, I am applying to Oxford. No, Oxford doesn't require STEP. No, I am not hokgod.

Although Oxford does not require STEP, it is clearly stated on its website that if the applicant has STEP grades, it will be taken into consideration. It seems to me that as long as you meet the 'official Cambridge requirement', which is 1, 1, taking STEP will not be a detriment to your application. I will not explain the reasoning behind this thought unless I get rejected by Oxford (but then my opinion should be discarded anyway).

However, it does seem to me that taking STEP will not bring your application to a whole new level even if you manage to get S, S. Several users on Zhihu have reported that some people getting 3s in STEP have been admitted yet some getting S, S have not. It is curious whether this information if true and if so, why Oxford has chosen to reject those getting S, S, who have surely also obtained a high mark in MAT.

Taking STEP is a personal choice, and it is not guaranteed to be beneficial to your application. I bear no responsibility for the validity of information presented in this text except for those directly related to me. Remember, no source of information about admissions can be taken without a grain of salt except for those directly stated on the University websites and personal experiences, which can be very misleading.
