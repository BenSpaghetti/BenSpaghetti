(Yeah I think this is it. I will update if I find more)

Anyway, I think three is more than enough. The common element in these problems are obviously the study of periods. Testing the concept of necessary and sufficient can be seen from the first 2 problems, it also seems to be on the rise recently. Anyway, that is what we are going to talk about in this article.

## Period

The first problem above is nice as it tells you the requirements of period. It is not worth losing marks on this lmao.
