# SPEEEEEEEEEEEEED

So as you may or may not know I have been feeling pretty trash for the last two years. Online lessons since F.3 might have had something to do with it. (I might have also had COVID without knowing it? I seem to recall thinking faint double line still means negative. At least nobody got COVID because of me.)

Anyway, I started this experiment of doing everything at like 1.5x speed for some time everyday on 2022-10-29, 4 days ago at the time of writing, and I have never felt so alive in a long time. The thought was that by attempting to move quickly, my brain would also realise its need to move quickly, and that has been confirmed by how I am feeling now. 

Might start a log of my journey into speed here.

## Week 1 so far
### Day 1 as I recall
This was a showerthought I think. So I started doing shower things at like double the speed before, and although I was knocking over some stuff, it was doable with some concentration, i.e. using brain. After getting out, I tried a typing test and beat my record. That alone should mean something. But there is more, I felt that I was getting more excited, less dead. My energy output increased a lot, and so will my metabolism. Might be a step towards being less obese? idk.
### Day 3
Done a MAT, aked mc in 40 min while I would have always screwed up at least 1 or 2 even with 50 min to 1 hour. Yes, I was able to really focus and think quickly, although this quickly died down after an hour. I guess I have to practice my stamina. A concern is that my thoughts will run with less depth, then my long-term mathematical ability will decline due to the shallower way by which I process knowledge. Even if this is true while thinking quickly, and I don't even know if this is the case yet, I can direct myself back to slow thinking. 

### Day 4
I have to say. This is like a drug, I get high when I start doing things quicker. My cheeks becomes hot and reddens, I start shaking my head etc.. Some part of my body has to move continuously otherwise I feel like I will explode. I am thinking of some way to redirect this energy to my brain, allowing it to work even harder. I think I did something like this in F.2 summer, where I accidentally drank some coke with caffeine and I was like super high and every part of my body was twitching. Yet I somehow refocused that into my brain and bulldozed that test. Quite fascinating.
