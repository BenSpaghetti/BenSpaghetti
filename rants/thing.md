a long time ago

there was a man

he has just settled down with his love

and prepared to live a long

peaceful

life

but then

things started to get fked up

you had a passionate night with your wife

she told you shes expecting

you are overjoyed

after some time

the child was born

all was well

this repeats and repeats

soon you hv a big family

one day

you smell something weird

you wander around, following that smell

to some place

that smells even more weird

boom

your dead

oh dear

you look down from heaven

weird creatures are chopping you into pieces

and putting you on a stick near a fire

oh dear why are they playing with fire

you check out your family

fk

that weird creature

found your home

soon

your children also faced the same end

you are bawling at this point

sob sob sob

but you are unable to look away

so you just keep looking

every once in a while

your wife gives birth to another thing that looks like a child

but you know it doesnt hv your genes

only hers

and it will never grow to see the day 

every time

the weird creatures take them away

and the love of your life just stares at her empty home

ai

ai

ai

you hear

ai

ai

ai

you sighed

wt a tragedy

sad

you are

and every once in a while

you become sadder

alas

your wife joins you in heaven one day

but twice the people, double the sadness

so you looked

and looked

and kept on looking

with her

but

somehow

one day

your wife told you

they cant come up here and take away our child again

so you had a child

but you have looked for too long

your reproductive system dont work anymore 

so you end up

with that thing that doesnt hv your genes

that the weird creatures take away

only they cant take it away now

ai

lets go

you said

so you and your wife, left that thing there

and flew away
