# Sail the High Seas in EU4
2022-04-13

Note: This is an UNFINISHED Cornwall EU4 guide and has NOTHING to do with sailing the high seas in REAL LIFE.

## Sail the High Seas for EU4
Note: This works only if you use BillGatesOS and have the base game. 

Before you sail the High Seas in EU4, you must sail them for EU4. I play 1.30.6 EU4 and have stopped sailing after the Humble Bundle Incident, look out for more of these incidents in the future!

We must all hail the Captain [Vladimir Rurikovich](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-keyh3itXk-WXJtvRiIyQ). You may find the most updated version in his YouTube channel, but this guide will be only for version 1.30.

Keys:
[DLCs](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1rg4uhw0dfftwkl/all_dlcs_vladimir_rurikovich.rar/file), [Unlocker](http://www.mediafire.com/file/rra6hpb5xtq52co/Emperor_DLC_Unlocker_Vladimir_Rurikovich.rar/file)

1. From the first link, put the files in the DLC directory in game files folder (should be accessible from Steam, highly recommend creating a shortcut). 
2. Ignoring the DLC files from the second link, put the files in the first directory into the game files folder. 
3. Then, put those in the second directory into the launcher folder.
