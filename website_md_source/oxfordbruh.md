# Oxford Adjusted Its HKDSE Entry Requirements

As title.

Now we need 5 in English, 5 in Core, 5* in M2, 5*, 5 in two other electives. This comes as a shock, as it is a large adjustment from the previous rather low requirements. It is rather unnice to change the requirements long after most schools have finished exams to determine predicted grades. This may exclude some students from applying, even though this standard of grades is to be expect from good universities like Oxford.

Does this mean Oxford considers exam grades of higher priority now? I don't know, but it is a scary thought.
