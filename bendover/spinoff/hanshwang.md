Hans got off the train and walked into the nearest Döner Kebab shop. His last stay in Rennes visiting Ben had nearly starved him with the terrible French cuisine. As he once again felt the warm bread in his hands, after a painful few days, he let out a long held sigh. Finally some good authentic German food, he thought. He took another bite of the juicy kebab meat and watched the busy transportation hub. What a mess, just like Ben's life.

He head out the station down the road and went for a leisurely walk in the Botanical Garden just beside the University of Bone. This is his third spring there by now and he loved seeing the flowers blossom, but loved even more seeing them wilt. Baytoufen's Sunlight Concerto flowed through his head, mixing with the serene beauty of the garden. He was enjoying this ethereal moment for a few seconds until he saw some old people staring into his soul. Scheiße, he forgot that it was his phone's ringtone. Pyotr Jobgiver, one of his advisors, was requesting his presence. He sauntered out and walked into the bustling university. 

He remembered the time he was young, just like them. He had the perfect university experience during his two years at Trollroto, but alas no, he could not turn off the offer to study masters at his dream school. He quickly graduated in the following semester, embarking on a new journey. While recollecting his memories, his feet had already taken him to Prof. Dr. Jobgiver's office.
