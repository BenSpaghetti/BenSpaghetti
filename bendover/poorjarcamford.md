Oh no, Mr Dover has discovered that he holds no talent in mathematics at all. He barely scraped a pass in his first year examinations. All dreams of future valour has been destroyed. He is very self-destructive and sees himself as vile. He no longer wishes to pursue a career in mathematics. 

Four years later, having taken virtually every applied course he can in the mathematics department, he became a master of numerical analysis, mathematics biology, stochastic processes, etc. He went on to work in finance, his most hated subject, after becoming his most hated person. 2 years later he earns 10 million bald eagle dollars every year working as the senior financial analyst. He married happily with his dream girl a few years down and his children are sent to the finest schools. Ben Dover Jr., Mr Dover's first son went on to study at Princeton at the young age of 16 and published his now famous Inter-Multiversal Teabag Theory at age 20 and received the Farmland Medal for his work in the 2042 ICM, becoming the youngest person to ever obtain a Farmland Medal.
