The Ben Dover project has paused, and maybe (hopefully), ended for good. Thank you for your support throughout these two years. I believe that I created Ben Dover as a coping mechanism, so that he could do what I could not, under the circumstances. Now that these circumstances have improved somewhat, I get to do what I want to do, and I have the chance to achieve what I want to achieve, or what Ben Dover has, in some way or another, already achieved in our imagination.
