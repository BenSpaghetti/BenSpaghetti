Training to become a geometer? Love visual thinking? Well Skribbl.io might be the game for you. 

## Rules
british spelling \
all lower case \
all singular, unless requires plural (isomorphic, homeomorphic, etc.) \
\- replaced by space \
\' gets deleted \
no using maths symbols \
no using letters \
drawing relevant to maths slightly preferred
