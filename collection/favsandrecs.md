## Jekyll Theme
Chirpy, duh.

If you want a less powerful theme, I find minima (the default theme) to be sufficient

## Chocolate

85% or 90% Cocoa chocolate, any higher it just becomes really dry and tasteless. You need the fat to carry the flavour I think.

For something sweet, I love Andes mint chocalate.
