Decide for yourself which is which, some are pretty obvious, some are surprising. 

## Jekyll Theme
Chirpy, duh.

If you want a less powerful theme, I find minima (the default theme) to be sufficient.

## Wheat products???

Garlic bread

EDO Almond Cracker

Hansel Premium New York-style Cheddar Cheese Cream-Filled Biscuits \
the naming is lamentable, it's the one in the black box

## Chocolate

85% or 90% Cocoa chocolate, any higher it just becomes really dry and tasteless. You need the fat to carry the flavour I think.

For something sweet, I love Andes mint chocalate.
