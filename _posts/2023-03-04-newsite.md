Yeah new site. The old site was too messy so I decided to actually use jekyll properly.

Hopefully Lost is some cringy name I came up with that sounded right. I am clearly lost, trying to do maths when I'm so bad at it. I am also naively hopeful. Being hopefully lost is obviously very dangerous, which reflects my extent of dumb.
