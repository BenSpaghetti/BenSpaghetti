This is an updating post on what to expect (and to remind me) from the blog.

1. How to get rejected from [Oxford](https://www.carousell.com.hk/p/oxford-maths-reject-experience-sharing-1232542313/)
4. Change of domain name and title to Peasant Maths, consistent with my YouTube channel (or maybe not, hopefully lost sounds fun)
5. Life update on university, personal projects, etc. after DSE at least once a month
6. Possibly a rewrite of my curve sketching series
7. Continuation of Ben Dover (don't really feel like it at this time)
8. Restructuring the website: adding view by category and stuff like that
9. polynomial factorisation trilogy
