*This list is incomplete; I can help by expanding it.*

Does not include poor habits and personality flaws.

1. Chose medicine subjects for DSE when I had 0 intention of going into medicine
2. Chose chemistry and biology to get into G class, when I really wanted to take some other subjects
3. Took STEP when I didn't need to
4. Did not [apply sideways](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/) even if I wasn't applying to MIT
