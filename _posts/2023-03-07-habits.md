title: Habits I learned from STEP
categories: education

I should recall what enabled me to do STEP problems nearly a year ago.

1. One equation per line
2. Clear, big writing
3. Leave space between letters and lines
4. Read the whole question before attempting
5. Rest for a few seconds after finishing a question to clear your head
6. List methods that you thought of and attempt them one by one
7. What can't be solved by computation, can be solved by double the computation
8. Don't try to judge if your method will work
9. If you follow the above, you should make little mistakes. Believe in yourself!
10. Drink more water
