This is an updating post on what to expect (and to remind me) from the blog.

1. How to get rejected from Oxford
4. Change of domain name and title to Peasant Maths, consistent with my YouTube channel
5. Life update on university, personal projects, etc. after DSE at least once a month
6. Possibly a rewrite of my curve sketching series
7. Continuation of Ben Dover
8. Restructuring the website: adding view by category and stuff like that
9. polynomial factorisation trilogy
