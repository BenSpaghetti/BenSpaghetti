I hate indices, every last one of them. I don't mean indices as in power, the little number on the top right corner of a bigger number, nor a measure of something, often seen ticking in stock exchanges or something like that I don't know finance or whatever this is.

What I mean is $i$, the most commonly used dummy variable to denote a cycle. By extension, I hate dealing with quadruply nested sums in linear algebra, for loops of more than one layer (or has more than three variables that vary with the index), and enumerative combinatorics.

There is no maths in this post.
