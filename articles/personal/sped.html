<h1 id="speeeeeeeeeeeeed">SPEEEEEEEEEEEEED</h1>
<p>Published 2022-11-02</p>
<p>So as you may or may not know I have been feeling pretty trash for
the last two years. Online lessons since F.3 might have had something to
do with it. (I might have also had COVID without knowing it? I seem to
recall thinking faint double line still means negative. At least nobody
got COVID because of me.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this experiment of doing everything at like 1.5x
speed for some time everyday on 2022-10-29, 4 days ago at the time of
writing, and I have never felt so alive in a long time. The thought was
that by attempting to move quickly, my brain would also realise its need
to move quickly, and that has been confirmed by how I am feeling
now.</p>
<p>Might start a log of my journey into speed here.</p>
<h2 id="week-1-so-far">Week 1 so far</h2>
<h3 id="day-1-as-i-recall">Day 1 as I recall</h3>
<p>This was a showerthought I think. So I started doing shower things at
like double the speed before, and although I was knocking over some
stuff, it was doable with some concentration, i.e. using brain. After
getting out, I tried a typing test and beat my record. That alone should
mean something. But there is more, I felt that I was getting more
excited, less dead. My energy output increased a lot, and so will my
metabolism. Might be a step towards being less obese? idk. ### Day 3
Done a MAT, aked mc in 40 min while I would have always screwed up at
least 1 or 2 even with 50 min to 1 hour. Yes, I was able to really focus
and think quickly, although this quickly died down after an hour. I
guess I have to practice my stamina. A concern is that my thoughts will
run with less depth, then my long-term mathematical ability will decline
due to the shallower way by which I process knowledge. Even if this is
true while thinking quickly, and I don’t even know if this is the case
yet, I can direct myself back to slow thinking.</p>
<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>
<p>I have to say. This is like a drug, I get high when I start doing
things quicker. My cheeks becomes hot and reddens, I start shaking my
head etc.. Some part of my body has to move continuously otherwise I
feel like I will explode. I am thinking of some way to redirect this
energy to my brain, allowing it to work even harder. I think I did
something like this in F.2 summer, where I accidentally drank some coke
with caffeine and I was like super high and every part of my body was
twitching. Yet I somehow refocused that into my brain and bulldozed that
test. Quite fascinating.</p>
