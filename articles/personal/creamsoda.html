<h1 id="cream-soda">Cream Soda</h1>
<p>The Cream Soda is perhaps among the most bizarre and perplexing human
inventions. I have only tasted that green-and-yellow canned one by
Schweppes but I would suspect my experiences collide with drinkers of
other brands and variations too.</p>
<p>Cream is smooth, soda pops. They are like bouba and kiki, oil and
water. I might read more on the invention of cream soda later but, for
now, bear with me on what mistaken impression I fully flesh out
below.</p>
<p>The first striking aspect of cream soda, even before you pull on the
ring, is an interesting combination of green and yellow on the can. What
do we think of when we hear cream? Icing on cakes? Buttercream? Maybe
even cream pies. Anyway, we know that it’s often used to make
mellow-tasting foods. When we think of soft drinks, we think of Coke and
Pepsi, or Dr Pepper if you are ’Murican. The bright red and deep blue
seem to be more prominent than this green-and-yellow combo. It just pops
and conducts a forced search into your eyeballs without a warrant. The
intelligent reader might realise that Sprite is also green-and-yellow.
Indeed, it is also a transparent and a lighter drink than the dark
syrupy stuff you get otherwise. You go in with a expectation of light
sweetness: about the only thing common with both cream and
green-and-yellow soda.</p>
<p>Oh sweet it is! Just as you hear the sharp crack when you pull on the
ring, the overbearing sweet aroma slams you right in the face. Too sweet
maybe. You look into the can and see the piss-coloured carbonated liquid
and wonder why the hell you bought this instead of good old coke. You
take a drink and still think that you are going to get diabetes from
this. Where is the cream? You don’t know, but you can’t help but take
another swig to attempt at grasping the sophisticated flavour, how ever
impossible it may seem. There used to be vanilla flavoured Coca Cola
when I was small. The first time I bought it, I spit it out. Oh god it
was awful, yet I kept coming back to it over and over again. Again, the
complex flavours overwhelmed me as a kid. I suppose curiosity kills the
cat, or in this case, the desire to decipher the alien taste of
vanilla-flavoured coke kills me. It was something truly different, and I
hate it. I suppose cream soda is reminiscent of this atrocity but
actually mildly pleasant. The creaminess is in both the taste and the
smell, but thank god it didn’t penetrate into the texture. The foaminess
was what really turned me off vanilla coke now that I think about it.
The perfect refreshing crispness was still locked inside the liquid,
escaping as we speak. After all, that is about the only reason we drink
soda.</p>
<p>Of course, you take another sip. This time it was pure sugar, as is
with other fizzy drinks once you taste it in minimal amounts and got
used to the fragrance. Again you start doubting your choice on trying
something novel. You walk closer to the trash can unconsciously. Cream
soda, what an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Sigh, let’s take another swig and just get this done with. You empty
the can, miss your shot, and saunter to the trash can to pick up your
can and throw it properly this time. The next time you choose your
drink, maybe you won’t give it more than a moment of thought, but those
moments add up, and a few months down, the green-and-yellow can pops to
you ever so seductively.</p>
