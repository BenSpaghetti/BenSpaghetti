<h1 id="eu4-meath-1.30.6-guide">EU4 Meath 1.30.6 Guide</h1>
<p>published 2022/03/26</p>
<h2 id="why-meath">Why Meath?</h2>
<p>Meath does not exist at game start unfortunately. Its capital (and
only province) Mide, also known as the Pale, is owned by England at the
start of the game. From <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Meath">Wikipedia</a>, the
province Meath is the traditional seat of the High Kings, even today,
this area contains Dublin, the Irish capital (although the present
County Meath is a separate entity and Meath is no longer a
province).</p>
<p>I do realise this does not answer the question of why Meath lol.</p>
<h2 id="our-starting-position">Our starting position</h2>
<p>We choose England at game start, and release and play as Meath. We
are a vassal under England at game start (similar to Cornwall, in fact,
I referenced <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/JMCXeGP">this Cornwall
guide</a>). England is particularly rich in content at game start, with
events like the Surrender of Maine and the War of the Roses.</p>
<p>As a newly released nation, our ruler is randomly generated. This
guarantees a good ruler as long as we are willing to bird. You have 100%
crownland game start. You WILL be rich for a few years after gaining
independence from England.</p>
<h2 id="first-day-moves">First day moves</h2>
<p>Not much, we must make use of what we have to gain a strong position.
If we have a ruler high in admin, then we can safely choose to focus on
military, if not, focus on admin. We will be doing a lot of coring after
gaining independence. I highly recommend making use of our full
crownland and choose the 3 priviledges that give you monarch points. The
rest is not really important (you can choose to sell your crownland some
time later for some money).</p>
<p>Start improving relations with some of your potential allies. After
that, perhaps try to make claims on England and Ireland.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-to-gain-independence">Preparing to gain
independence</h2>
<p>The possible countries you may ask to support your independence are:
Scotland, France, Burgundy, Castile and Aragon. England will ally some
of these countries at game start, but I highly recommend restarting
until Burgundy rivals England for a chance at the Burgundian
Inheritance. From my own experience, I do not recommend asking for
support from Scotland in most cases as they are one of your main targets
after gaining independence and are reluctant to support you anyway.</p>
<p>From my past experience, France and Burgundy can deal with England’s
continental allies, particularly those in Iberia like Portugal. Denmark
is usually a very good choice too. The combined army and navy of
Scandinavia can easily overpower England, and they will actually land
troops on England and achieve full occupation.</p>
<p>Similar to the Cornwall guide, it is advisable not to build up your
army at first to conserve money. You should use the monarch points to
develop your province after a few years to increase your force limit and
loan cap. Remember to turn on the state edict to get dev cost
reduction.</p>
<p>Remember that you have a 15 year truce with England, and that they
will start to annex you some time after that. It does take a while
though.</p>
<p>Some countries, particularly England, may choose to influence you,
giving you some monarch points too.</p>
<h2 id="independence">Independence</h2>
<p>The events for England are vital to your independence.</p>
<h3 id="surrender-of-maine">Surrender of Maine</h3>
<p>The Surrender of Maine is a good opportunity to get England to land
on France, thus allowing you to fully occupy the island. However, this
is difficult to execute as the timing is random. If it takes place too
early, your truce with England is still active. If it takes place too
late, England is going to start annexing you.</p>
<p>Even if the timing is fine, sometimes England may choose not to
deploy their troops on to her French lands. Note that it is advisable to
ask Scotland for support if you do choose to take this opportunity. It
may be possible that not a lot of loans are needed in this case.</p>
<p>If England chooses to return Maine to France, it will allow you to
ask France to support independence if the event did not take place too
late. This is the one I prefer and the only one I have played with.</p>
<h3 id="war-of-the-roses">War of the Roses</h3>
<p>idk anything about that idk why never happened in my 3 runs</p>
<h3 id="during-the-war">During the War</h3>
<p>Remember to keep an eye on your debt. Take the one 1% interest loans
from Burghers instead of normal loans as often as possible. Remember
that you may cancel the priviledge and reissue to to get 5 more loans.
If you do not have Scotland as an ally, do NOT engage with English
troops unless for some reason you have an advantage (no, mountain forts,
morale advantages don’t count), even if they are sieging down your
capital. Trying sieging down some English lands, perhaps even a fort if
possible (probably not).</p>
<h3 id="peace">Peace</h3>
<p>Remember that in addition to gaining your independence and possibly
get some lands, you are probably burdened with loans. You must try to
strengthen yourself economically too. One should prioritise war
reparations over money since you probably have low war contribution.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Scandinavians have landed and fully occupied all of
England and freed your capital, separately peace out England’s allies
for money and war reparation, perhaps some land for your allies too. For
any alliance you wish to keep, make sure that their trust of you will
not be reduced by giving them some land else they will break the
alliance.</p>
<p>If you are still fully occupied and it does not seem like anyone will
land on England, do NOT peace out all of England’s allies. Depending on
the situation, you may want to peace out one of them for some money and
war reparation and peace the other one out together with England,
gaining independence and possibly war reparations. Peacing out all
allies without England will result in your annexation.</p>
<p>For the peace deal with England, if possible, I highly recommend
taking land in Wales and Cornwall. ## After independence</p>
<p>Hopefully you have some claims on Ireland now. With the war
reparations, your economy will be fine for a few years. Hire some
mercenaries and conquer Ireland and Scotland. You may choose to start
conquring in mainland Europe, particularly in Brittany if you can make
claims on it.</p>
<p>Pay off some loans, prioritising those with normal interest rates
Retake the Burgher loans, they will be bigger now. Use them to pay off
your smaller loans. Your economy will be poor after the war reparations
stop. You should attack England as often as possible, prioritsing lands
in the English Channel to build up your trade income.</p>
<p>As Ireland, going colonial is the standard move. However, I do not
recommend picking exploration as the first idea and instead recommend
economic, offensive or quantity in order to sustain a strong army to aid
you in defeating England.</p>
<p>If you have allied Burgundy, you may choose to savescum for
Burgundian Inheritance, elevating you to one of the Great Powers
immediately and giving you possibilities of conquest in the European
mainland. However, Burgundy will engage in suicidal wars against France,
England and the HRE and you may have to end up breaking the alliance. If
you did not get the Burgundian Inheritance, it is rather difficult as
your main and probably the only target is France, who is much stronger
than you on land.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Although this guide is for 1.30.6, I believe that this is still
largely applicable to the new patches (at least at the time of writing).
Also, remember that I don’t know what I’m talking about.</p>
