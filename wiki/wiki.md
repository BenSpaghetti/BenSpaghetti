# Wikipedia browsing

I am currently reading about the history of Ireland.

To avoid forgetting everything I have read, perhaps I will upload some expository writings to the [Article section](/rants/rants.md) of this website.

## Things to read about in the future
Note: probably subject to changes every day
1. England in the early modern period
2. Maoism
3. Algeria and France

## Topics I have explored in the past
I have probably forgotten most of these lol.
